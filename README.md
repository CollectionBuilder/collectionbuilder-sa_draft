# collectionbuilder-sa_draft

draft of a stand alone style collection.
uses data from [Moscon](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/moscon/), but not really customized to the collection.
Objects are simply in a folder.
Every object has an image in "thumbs" and "small" named after `objectid`, and an original object item in the root folder named after `filename` column.
